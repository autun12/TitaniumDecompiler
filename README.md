# Titanium Decompiler
Writing my own decompiler for fun. 

## How to build 
Clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/autun12/TitaniumDecompiler`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
